This project was created as part of my first course in Front-End Development.
During this course, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and applied them to build a simple bookstore web application called The Next Chapter.
As my first frontend project, it represents my learning journey and the foundation of my development skills.
This project helped me understand how structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and functionality (JavaScript) work together to create a complete web application.
